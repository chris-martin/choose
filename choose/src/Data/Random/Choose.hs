{- | A mechanism to select some fixed number of items uniformly at random from
an input stream, using constant space.

We store items on a 'Tree', moving them down into randomly-selected branches.
After we add items to the tree ('addToTree'), we take prune its leftmost items
('treeTakeRight'). It may be helpful to think of this a @Tree k a@ as a bag of
items of type @a@ with "score" of type @[k]@ lazily assigned to each item. The
length of the score is /d/, where /d/ is the maximum depth of the tree. Moving
an item downwards through the tree corresponds to appending a @k@ to its score.
Note that the laziness is necessary because /d/ is not known a priori. The
process of moving items futher down the tree is referred to as disambiguation
('disambiguateTree') because its purpose is to resolve "ties" in the score. -}
